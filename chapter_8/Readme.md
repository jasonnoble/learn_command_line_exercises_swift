# Chapter 8: Moving around (pushd, popd)

## Do More

### Use these commands to move around directories all over your computer.

`pushd /tmp`
`popd`
`pushd ~/Documents`
`popd`

### Remove the i/like/icecream directories and make your own, then move around in them.

`mkdir -p tmp/joe/smith/hates/icecream`
`pushd tmp/joe/smith`
`popd`

### Explain to yourself the output that pushd and popd print out to you. Notice how it works like a stack?

Cool!

### You already know this, but remember that mkdir -p will make an entire path even if all the directories don't exist. That's what I did very first for this exercise.

How could I forget?
