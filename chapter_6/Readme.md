# Chapter 6: List Directory (ls)

## Do More

### On Unix, try the ls -lR command while you're in temp.

`ls -lR` shows me a long listing of the files, and does it recursively, so it shows all the directories and files under my current directory.

### Use cd to get to other directories on your computer then use ls to see what's in them.

`cd ~/Music/iTunes`

`ls` shows me:

    Jasons-iMac:iTunes jasonn$ ls
    Album Artwork			iTunes Library.itl
    Previous iTunes Libraries	iTunes Media
    iTunes Library Extras.itdb	iTunes Music Library.xml
    iTunes Library Genius.itdb	sentinel
    Jasons-iMac:iTunes jasonn$

### Update your notebook with new questions. I know you probably have some, because I'm not covering everything about this command.

I don't have any questions.

### Remember that if you get lost, then use ls and pwd to figure out where you are, then go to where you need to be with cd.

Ok.
