`pwd` shows me I'm in the `/Users/jasonn/workspace/davinci/swift_t1_2016/homework/learn_command_line_exercises_swift` directory.

Opening Finder, I go to jasonn -> workspace -> davinci -> swift_t1_2016 -> homework -> learn_command_line_exercises_swift.

I could also do `open .` to open a finder window in the current directory.
